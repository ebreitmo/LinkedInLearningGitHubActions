## Course Description

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration tool that allows developers to automate tasks for their software projects. In this course, learn how to use this powerful tool to create workflows triggered by events, implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and develop custom actions. Instructor Michael Jenkins shows you how to get started with actions and the workflows that run them. He also demonstrates how to use actions from the GitHub Marketplace and public repositories, leverage the capabilities of GitHub Actions to support your CI/CD workflow, and plan and develop custom actions.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Course Structure

This repository is organized into directories that correspond to the videos and exercises in the course. Each chapter has its own directory, and within each chapter directory are subdirectories for each video or exercise.

The course is organized into the following chapters:
