# 03_08 Solution: Develop a CI/CD Pipeline for a Python Script

In this challenge, you‚Äôll develop a GitHub Actions workflow for a Python script.

The goal is to build a full CI/CD pipeline that includes linting and tests, artifact creation, and artifact testing.

You‚Äôll also configure your workflow to use the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) to store and retrieve the image.

## Overview

You will complete the following steps in this challenge:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** using the Python `.gitignore` template
2. **Use the repository in the GitHub Web Editor** to add code and workflows
3. **Add the provided files**:

   - [`hello.py`](./hello.py) (Python script)
   - [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) (for building the image)
   - [`.dockerignore`](./.dockerignore) (for building the image)
   - [`python-pipeline.yml`](./python-pipeline.yml) (your CI/CD workflow)

4. **Implement a three-stage pipeline**:

   - Lint and test the Python code
   - Build and push the container image to GHCR
   - Pull and run the image to verify output

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Lint and test the Python code] --> B[Build and push the container image to GHCR]
        B --> C[Pull and run the image to verify output]
    ```

5. **Push changes to the repository** and confirm the workflow runs successfully

This challenge should take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Instructions

### Create a New Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and select **New repository**
2. Name the repository (e.g., `python-ci-cd`)
3. Choose **Public** or **Private** visibility
4. Select **Add .gitignore** and choose the **Python** template
5. Select **Create repository**

### Add Files to the Repository in the GitHub Web Editor

1. Press the `.` key in your new repo or navigate to `https://github.dev/your-user-name/you-repo-name`
2. Add the following files to your repo.
   - ***NOTE: Be sure to place the workflow file in the correct location.***
3. Commit all files to your repo and push the changes.

- `hello.py`

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

- `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

COPY hello.py .

CMD ["python", "hello.py"]
```

- `.dockerignore`

```shell
.github
.git
.gitignore
README.md
```

- `python-pipeline.yml`

```yaml
