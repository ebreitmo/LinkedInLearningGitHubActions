# 04_01 Plan a Custom Action

In this lesson, we explore the essential components needed to develop a custom GitHub Action from scratch.

## Summary

We’ll walk through the core elements required for a custom action:

- A clear objective
- A dedicated public repository
- A Dockerfile to define the container runtime
- A script to hold the action logic
- Metadata file
- README file for documentation

This foundational plan sets the stage for the upcoming hands-on lessons.

## Key Concepts

- **Custom Actions** provide flexibility for specific project needs beyond pre-built Marketplace actions.
- **Planning** ensures that your custom action is reusable, maintainable, and easy to share.
